# Aviation-Mechanical-Failure-Prediction
Gathering aviation engine operating data is crucial for conducting predictive maintenance because it enables proactive identification and resolution of potential issues before they lead to costly failures or operational disruptions.

Analyzing aviation engine data is challenging due to the sheer volume and complexity of information from more than 26 sensors monitoring parameters like temperature, pressure, and vibration. The interdependence of these readings, combined with varying data formats and frequencies, makes identifying meaningful patterns difficult. Advanced tools are required but often struggle with the scale and intricacy of the data, complicating predictive maintenance efforts.

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive maintenance model to anticipate failures in A320 aircraft. This is achieved through three main steps: first, collecting and processing data from physical sensors; second, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques like SVM and CNN to analyze patterns, uncover correlations, and forecast potential outcomes; and finally, validating the model's performance and making necessary adjustments to enhance its accuracy.
